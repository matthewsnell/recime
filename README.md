# SETUP LAUNCHING APP RECIPES LOCALLY

1. Create a mobile hotspot on your phone (recommended)

2. Now your computer is connected - open a command terminal and run `ipconfig`

3. Copy the IPv4 IP Address.

4. In `app/src/Constants.js` change IPAddress variable to your copied value.

!Note = we will move this to environment variables later.
